          <h5><p class="left-align light">The solar systems can be classified into 3 different categories based on their grid-connectivity.<br>
                1. On-Grid Solar – connected to electricity board supply.<br>
                2. Off-Grid Solar – standalone system with battery backup, not connected to electricity board supply.<br>
                3. Hybrid system- Mix system, connected to electricity board supply as well as having a battery backup.<br>

          <h5><p class="left-align light">On-Grid Solar power system is a solar power generation system where it is connected to the Electricity Grid. The electricity produced by the system is routed to the grid from where it is used to run the various appliances. The excess power at any point of time is transmitted back to the grid.
            An on-grid solar system is much more attractive than an off-grid system. In an on-grid solar system, solar power is produced only when the grid is available. The power supply gets completely cut-off in case of the grid outage. Hence, one needs to depend on back-ups such as conventional Home invertor or DG set for emergency power supply.

              <h5><p class="left-align light">This system works in two-ways — the supply of electricity can flow from the grid to which it is connected to the user’s home and from the user’s home to the grid. This feature makes the on-grid solar system affordable and highly useful. The solar panels, installed on the user’s home are ‘tied’ to the grid.<br>
                ~ The solar panels convert sunlight into electric energy, which is DC (Direct Current).<br>
                ~ This current is then sent to an inverter. The solar inverter then converts the DC to 240V AC (Alternating Current).<br>
                ~ This electricity is then routed to the grid where it is supplied for day to day use.<br>
                ~ The grid-tied inverter additionally regulates the amount and voltage of electricity fed to the household since all the power generated is mostly much more than a home needs or can handle.<br>
                ~ An important feature is a net meter. It is a device that records the energy supplied to the grid and the energy consumed.<br>
                ~ At the end of each month, the outstanding is recorded and the consumer is provided with a bill. This ‘converted’ power supply is then used by homes through the main electricity distribution panel. The annual reconciliation is done once in a year to adjust the units.
